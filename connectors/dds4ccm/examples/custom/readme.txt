This test shows that the code, generated by the RIDL compiler,
can be put in a different directory than the business code.

In this example the business code is available in the 'src'
directory while the generated code will be put in a new
directory, called 'build'.
The libraries will be put in a directory called 'lib'.

The MPC is responsible for the inclusion of the correct
directories.
The RIDL compiler should not generate include
directives, containing the generated code directory.
If it does, the compiler will complain about this.
