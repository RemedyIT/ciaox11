The purpose of this test is to show how the make-process step by step can be carried out,
when no use is made of the 'all-in' mpc projects which are used in the other tests of the ami4ccm suite,
but instead of using separate mpc projects.

Details of this test:
- This test is an example of step by step generating and processing the idl files needed for an
   ami4ccm connector and a component, using ami4ccm.
- This test is using seperate DLL's for all kind of stubs, skel and lem_stub's, which are needed for a complete test.
   In most other tests of the ami4ccm suite, this DLL's aren't separated, but joined as much as possible to one DLL.
- This test doesn't use a generated_code dir, as do the most test of the ami4ccm suite.
