This directory contains two examples.

The basic example shows how the same philosophy can be realized by using another
MPC structure.

The most important difference is that the pattern MPC project is combined with the
base stub MPC project and that the implementation of the CORBA connector is put in
the 'corba_connector' directory.

See the extended hello example for an explanation of the directory structure
used in that example.
