=== RTI Connext DDS

The RTI Connext DDS product is integrated without the usage of the CORBA
Compatibility Kit (CCK). The CCK is used by CIAO but not CIAOX11. The
removed dependency on the CCK means in practice that the RTI Community
Edition can be used as underlying DDS product for CIAOX11. Be aware that
the CCK does change any unbounded IDL type to a bounded IDL type with a
pre-defined bound. In order to get 100% interoperability make sure that
in CIAOX11 you use the same bound as the part of the system that does
use the CCK.

RTI Connext DDS can be obtained from https://www.rti.com/[RTI]. Contact
