1. Definitions

  - A Developer Subscription Certificate (hereinafter called "DSC") is a separate
    document issued by Remedy IT to You specifying the details of the licenses
    that You are granted. You may have multiple DSCs. If You do not have a DSC,
    then Your use is as specified under "Evaluation License" below.

  - A "Project" is a carefully planned, collaborative enterprise to design or
    produce a Software Product or set of Software Products that has a specified
    scope of functionality, as specified in the DSC.

  - A "Site" is a physical location or set of locations, including reasonable
    remote access, as specified in the DSC.

    software program that requires physical incorporation or linking of portions
    of the Software to execute.

  - A "User" is a person on the Project team who has used the Software for any
    purpose in the preceding six (6) months, including to develop, test, stage,
    or run an SAP.

  - Development use is developing code that links to and uses the Software either
    directly or indirectly through any number of encapsulating Application
    Programmer Interface (API) layers. Development includes making copies of the
    library portions of the Software in object code form and linking or physically
    incorporating the copies into an SAP. Development includes any use of the
    Software's programming and support tools, configurations, or other components
    of the Software with a User Interface (UI).

  - A "Developer" is a User who does Development.

  - A "Workstation" is a single (physical or emulated or virtual) computer used
    by a Developer.

  - A "Platform" is a single combination of computer Operating System, computer
    hardware and development software used to develop and execute SAPs.

  - A "Supported Platform" is a Platform capable of executing SAPs created with
    the Software.

  - The "Term" is the active period of this Agreement, as specified in the DSC.


2. License

  All licenses are non-transferable and non-exclusive. Use is limited to the
  designated Site and Project, on the Licensed Workstation(s) and the Supported
  Platform(s) as defined in the DSC. For each license, You must pay Remedy IT fees
  in accordance with Remedy IT's then-current, applicable, published price list,
  or as may be specifically agreed to in writing between You and Remedy IT.

  2.1. Developer License

    If You have a DSC that specifies a number of Developer Licenses, then up to
    that number of Users may use the Software for Development during the Term.

  2.2. OEM Run-time License

    Unlimited, no-cost OEM Run-time licenses are included with each Developer
    License allowing You to physically incorporate copies of the Software into
    SAPs and distribute those SAPs. Such copies may be made only at the Site of
    the Project, on the Licensed Workstation(s) and the Supported Platform(s) as
    stated in the DSC specifying the Developer License. These terms apply to all
    such SAPs:

      a. You agree to keep records of the numbers of SAPs you distribute. Remedy
         IT shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to examine Your records
         regarding such practices.

      b. SAPs may not contain software development functionality or Remedy IT
         source code.

      c. You must distribute your SAP to end users with a license that
         acknowledges Remedy IT's copyright, prevents further copying of the
         Software (except for backup purposes), and expressly disclaims all
         warranties by Remedy IT.

      d. THE SOFTWARE, WHEN INCORPORATED INTO AN SAP, IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
         WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. REMEDY IT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER
         EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

      e. Any valid end-user licenses to SAPs incorporating Software granted by You
         under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  2.3. Source License

    If you have a DSC that specifies a Source License, then You may use and modify
    the source code, and build  object versions of the original or modified source
    code.
    If You modify the source code, then You assign and convey all of Your copyright
    to such modifications and derivative works to Remedy IT. If for any reason You
    cannot assign Your copyright, then You grant Remedy IT a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, assignable, paid-up license to use, copy, modify, distribute,
    create derivative works, sub-license, and otherwise fully utilize the
    modifications without acknowledgment of ownership. You also assign or license
    to Remedy IT any other intellectual property rights required to fully use the
    modifications for any purpose. You agree to provide such modifications to Remedy
    IT upon request. Remedy IT may incorporate Your modifications into any future
    version of the Software or into other products at its sole option without fees
    or attribution.
    If You modify the Software, then all warranties are void. Unless agreed otherwise,
    Remedy IT has no obligation to support the modified Software.
    A Source License does not grant development or distribution rights; a Developer
    License (with the included  OEM Run-time License) is required for the right to
    create and distribute SAPs.

  2.4. Evaluation License

    If You have an Evaluation License, or have not received a DSC or one of the
    above licenses from Remedy IT,  or are using an evaluation or pre-production
    ("Beta" or "Early Access Release") version of the Software, then Remedy IT
    grants to You a temporary license to use the Software for the sole purpose
    of testing the suitability,  performance and usefulness of the software for
    Your business needs. You may not use the Software for Development (beyond
    prototypes) or commercial purposes.
    Unless extended by Remedy IT, the Beta or Evaluation period ("Term") concludes
    thirty (30) days from the date of Your first download or installation of the
    Software.

  For all types of licenses, if You elect to use the Software after the Term, You
  will need to acquire an appropriate license. This Agreement and the licenses it
  grants terminate at the end of the Term with the exception of the OEM Run-time
  license terms for any SAPs created during the Term. You may make a reasonable
  number of copies of the Software strictly for backup or archival purposes.


3. Additional Restrictions.

  3.1. Except as provided herein, You may not market, distribute or transfer copies
       of the Software to others. You may not rent, lease, loan or otherwise
       provide the Software to any third parties.

  3.2. You may not use the Software if You are a direct competitor or acting on
       behalf of a direct competitor of Remedy IT, except with Remedy IT's prior
       written consent. You may not use the Software for competitive purposes such
       as evaluating performance or functionality without Remedy IT's prior written
       consent.


4. Limited Warranty.

  4.1. Research and Nonprofit Licenses and Project Types (as defined in the DSC),
       Evaluation Licenses, and OEM Run-time Licenses are provided "as is" with
       no warranty whatsoever. The warranties in this section apply only to paid
       licenses for fully-released versions of the Software at the Site.

  4.2. Remedy IT warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance
       with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days
       from the date that the Software is first downloaded by You. Remedy IT does
       not warrant that the Software will meet Your requirements or operate free
       from error. This limited warranty gives You specific legal rights. You may
       have others, which vary from country to country.

  4.3. Remedy IT warrants that, other than documented license management technology,
       the Software as well as any medium used to provide the Software will be free
       of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, back or trap doors, or other
       debilitating or disabling devices or malicious code.

  4.4. Remedy IT warrants that the Software is subject to no restrictions or
       licenses that would require You to redistribute any of Your source code.

  4.5. Remedy IT's entire liability and Your sole and exclusive remedy for any
       breach of the foregoing warranty shall be, at Remedy IT's option, to either:
       (i)  return the price paid for the item of Software; or
       (ii) repair or replace the item of Software which is returned to Remedy IT
            with a copy of Your receipt.
       Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original
       warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

  4.6. Remedy IT DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
       THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
       NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR
       ADVICE GIVEN BY REMEDY IT, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES
       SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY
       AND YOU MAY NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.


5. Indemnities.

  5.1. Remedy IT will defend any suit brought against You and will pay all damages
       finally awarded in such suit insofar as such suit is based on a claim that
       the Software as provided to You infringes a copyright or patent, provided
       that Remedy IT is notified promptly of such claim and at its expense is given
       full and complete  authority (including settlement authority), information
       and assistance by You for such defense. In the event that the Software is
       held in any such suit to infringe such a right and its use is enjoined, or
       if in the opinion of Remedy IT the Software is likely to become the subject
       of such a claim, Remedy IT at its own election and expense will either:
       (i)  procure for You the right to continue using the Software;
       (ii) modify or replace the Software so that it becomes non-infringing
            while giving equivalent performance.
       In the event that (i) or (ii) above are not, in Remedy IT's sole determination,
       reasonably practicable, then Remedy IT may terminate this Agreement and
       refund an equitable portion of money paid by You in connection with the
       licenses granted hereunder.

  5.2. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Remedy IT harmless from any claim,
       lawsuit, legal proceeding, settlement or judgment (including without
       limitation Remedy IT's reasonable Dutch and local attorneys' and expert
       witnesses' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with the copying,
       marketing, performance or other distribution of the SAPs.

  5.3. REMEDY IT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
       DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS
       OF PROFITS, COSTS OF COVER, OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
       TO USE THE SOFTWARE (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR
       OTHERWISE) EVEN IF REMEDY IT OR ITS  REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
       THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  5.4. IN PARTICULAR, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE PART OF A SYSTEM
       USED TO CONTROL EXPENSIVE OR DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT. REMEDY IT SHALL NOT BE
       LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM THE OPERATION OF SUCH
       EQUIPMENT.
       You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Remedy IT harmless from any claim,
       lawsuit, legal proceeding, settlement or judgment (including without
       limitation Remedy IT's reasonable Dutch and local attorneys' and expert
       witnesses' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with the copying,
       marketing, performance or other distribution of Your SAPs.

  5.5. THE LIABILITY OF Remedy IT FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
       USE OF THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE
       GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEE FOR THE SOFTWARE OR EUR 10,000.

  5.6. THE LIMITED WARRANTY, LIMITED REMEDIES AND LIMITED LIABILITY SPECIFIED IN
       THIS AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN
       Remedy IT AND YOU. Remedy IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT
       SUCH LIMITATIONS.


6. Open Source

  6.1. Portions of the Software may be derived from works of contributors to open
       source projects (Contributors). Contributors disclaim all warranties,
       express or implied as to conditions of title non-infringement, merchantability
       or fitness to purpose. Contributors disclaim all liability for damages,
       including direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages. Any such
       warranties and liability are offered by Remedy IT alone as stated and limited
       in this Agreement.

       source works is available by emailing a request to "info@remedy.nl".

       of the computer equipment on which the Software is used.

  8.2. Except as may be provided above or in a separate Remedy IT Maintenance
       Agreement between Remedy IT and You, if any, Remedy IT is under no obligation

  You agree to use reasonable efforts not to disclose the Software to any third
  parties and not to use the Software other than for the purposes authorized by this
  Agreement. You also agree that performance, functionality or other competitive
  evaluation results shall not be disclosed to third parties without Remedy IT's
  prior written consent. This confidentiality obligation shall continue after any
  termination of this Agreement.


10. Termination.

  If the Term is designated as "Indefinite" in the DSC, then this Agreement will
  continue indefinitely unless terminated due to breach. If the Term is designated
  "Subscription" in the DSC, then this Agreement will terminate on the Expiration
  Date specified in the DSC unless terminated due to breach. In the event of a
  breach of this Agreement by either party, the other party may terminate this
  Agreement if such breach is not cured within 10 days on written notice. Upon
  termination, You agree not to use the Software for any purpose whatsoever and
  (except for reasonable backup archives) to destroy the Software and any copies
  then in Your possession or control, and (on request) certify in writing or via
  e-mail to Remedy IT that the Software was destroyed. The remedies specified in
  this Agreement shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Remedy IT.


11. General

  This Agreement will be governed by the Dutch law. This Agreement between Remedy
  IT and You combined with the Developer Subscription Certificate(s) issued to You by
  Remedy IT constitute the complete, final and exclusive statement of the agreement
  between Remedy IT and You, which supersedes all proposals, oral or written, and
  all other communications between the parties relating to the subject matter of
  this Agreement. No terms of Your purchase order nor any waiver, alteration or
  modification of the provisions of this Agreement will be valid unless made in
  writing and signed by a corporate officer of Remedy IT. Any controversy or claim
  arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be
  settled by Dutch law. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement are
  determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
  enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any
  way be affected or impaired thereby. Remedy IT may assign this Agreement to an
  entity acquiring essentially all of the Remedy IT's relevant business. You may
