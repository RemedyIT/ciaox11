This example demonstrated and verifies the remote, "connector", vs local, "direct"
connection options for synchronous request/reply interaction.

The test defines two interfaces:
1. 'local' interface Bar
2. interface Foo

For 1. no connectors can be generated and the *only* connection option is local.
For 2. a CORBA4CCM connector is generated.

The test demonstrates that:
- for 1. a using component instance can be connected to a colocated providing instance
- for 2. a using component instance can be connected to a remote deployed providing instance
  using two appropriately colocated (wrt the component instances) CORBA4CCM connector instances
  AND
  another using component instance can be connected to a colocated providing instance
