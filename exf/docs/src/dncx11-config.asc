==== CIAOX11 ExF Container Installation Handler

Dynamic module::
  `ciaox11_exf_deployment_handlers`

Factory::
  `create_CIAOX11_EXF_Container_Handler`

CONFIG descriptor::
  <<config-plan/config-instance-handler#,nl.remedy.it.DnCX11.InstanceHandler>>

Description::
  This instance deployment plugin handles life cycle management of ExF enabled session container instances in
  a deployed locality. By default all localities will have a single container instance created
  for management of component instances deployed to the locality but explicit container instances
  can be specified in the deployment plan (see <<Configuring Container instances in the Deployment Plan>> for more details). +
  This plugin is intended to be loaded by a
  locality deployment manager instance (see <<deployment-tools#_deployment_manager,here>> for more
  details) by adding an appropriate entry in the CONFIG file for that manager. +
  AXCIOMA ships this plugin (and it's associated plugins) with selected distribution editions but the plugins are *not*
  enabled in the default `localitymanager.config` file.

Configuration::
  This plugin can be configured with the properties shown in the table below. These properties can
  be specified either as <<config-plan/config-properties#_deployment_property_descriptors,deployment properties>>
  for the ExF Container instance handler descriptor in the deployment tool configuration (configuring the default
  Container instance for *every* LM instance) *or* for a specific Container instance
  definition in the deployment plan. See <<Configuring Container instances in the Deployment Plan,here>> for more detailed information. +
