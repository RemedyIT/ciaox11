=== RTI Connext DDS

The RTI Connext DDS product is integrated without usage of the
RTI CORBA Compatibility Kit (CCK). By not using the CCK the RTI
Connext DDS Community Edition could be used as underlying DDS product for DDSX11. Be aware
that when you have other system parts that do use the CCK, the CCK
changes any unbounded IDL type to a bounded IDL type of a
fixed length. In order to get 100% interoperability make sure that in
DDSX11 you use the same bound as the part of the system that uses the CCK.

DDSX11 supports `DDSX11_NDDS_LOG_VERBOSITY` and `DDSX11_NDDS_LOG_PRINT_FORMAT`
as environment variables with which you can configure the RTI Connext DDS
logging.

DDSX11 provides the following shared libraries that need to be linked with
your application when using RTI Connext DDS.

.DDSX11 libraries for RTI Connext DDS
[cols="<1,<3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Library |Purpose
|ddsx11_ndds_stub |Contains all IDL to C++11 stubs for the DDS defined IDL
types and interfaces. Required for any application that wants to use the
DDS API using RTI Connext DDS

|ddsx11_ndds_impl |Contains the DDX11 implementation, needed for any
application that uses DDSX11 directly using RTI Connext DDS. For AXCIOMA this library is only
required for the DDS4CCM connector libraries, components that use
DDS4CCM only need to link with the ddsx11_ndds_stub and ddx11_ndds_lem_stub
libraries

|ddsx11_ndds_lem_stub |The local executor mapping interfaces for the DDS
DataReader and DataWriter interfaces using RTI Connext DDS. This library is only needed for
AXCIOMA components that use DDSX11 through DDS4CCM
