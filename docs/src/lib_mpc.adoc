= Overview of the AXCIOMA libraries

*AXCIOMA* delivers the MPC base projects for several
component features. When you use MPC and want to use a certain
feature, all you have to do is to derive your project from the specific
MPC base project.

The base projects are located in the
`<package_root>/ciaox11/bin/MPC/config` directory and its subdirectories.

This overview shows the available *AXCIOMA* libraries and the MPC base
project(s) related to that library which pull in all needed dependencies.
