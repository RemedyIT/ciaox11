This tests specifically demonstrates how the MPC files (and therefor
the commandline options of the RIDL compiler) can be used.

Please also take a look at the 'gen_test_simple'. This test also focuses
on the MPC files and the commandline options of the RIDL compiler but in a
slimmed down way. It also explains the directory structure used in a typical
CIAOX11 test/example.

Specific help and comments are added to these MPC files in this directory.
