=== OpenDDS

OpenDDS is an optional integration. In order
to use this integration OpenDDS 3.24.1 has to be used.

The sources for OpenDDS must be retrieved separately
from the https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS[OpenDDS git repository].
The location where the OpenDDS sources are located has to be
passed to the `brix11 configure` command using the
`-W openddsroot=<dir>` commandline option. The OpenDDS core libraries
must be compiled as part of the AXCIOMA make in order to guarantee that
ACE, TAO, AXCIOMA, and OpenDDS are configured in a consistent matter.

DDSX11 supports `DDSX11_OPENDDS_LOG_LEVEL` and `DDSX11_OPENDDS_TRANSPORT_LOG_LEVEL`
as environment variables with which you can configure the OpenDDS logging.

DDSX11 provides the following shared libraries that need to be linked with
your application when using OpenDDS.

.DDSX11 libraries for OpenDDS
[cols="<1,<3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Library |Purpose
|ddsx11_opendds_stub |Contains all IDL to C++11 stubs for the DDS defined IDL
types and interfaces. Required for any application that wants to use the
DDS API using OpenDDS

|ddsx11_opendds_impl |Contains the DDX11 implementation, needed for any
application that uses DDSX11 directly using OpenDDS. For AXCIOMA this library is only
required for the DDS4CCM connector libraries, components that use
DDS4CCM only need to link with the ddsx11_opendds_stub and ddx11_opendds_lem_stub
libraries

|ddsx11_opendds_lem_stub |The local executor mapping interfaces for the DDS
DataReader and DataWriter interfaces using OpenDDS. This library is only needed for
AXCIOMA components that use DDSX11 through DDS4CCM
