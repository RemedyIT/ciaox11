= The AXCIOMA philosophy

== Overview

The following picture provides an overview of the roles and activities in a
typical *AXCIOMA* application development lifecycle.

.*AXCIOMA* development lifecycle
image:{images_root}/philosophy.png[image]

According to the above picture, the following roles and activities apply
in *AXCIOMA* application development:

Architect::

* Design the data types and interfaces in IDL
* Design the business component in IDL

Programmer/Tester::

* Compile all IDL
* Implement the business code
* Compile the business code
* Test the business components

Deployment planner::

* Model the deployment
* Design the desired QoS settings (if applicable)
* Deploy the application

== Roles

=== Architect

First of all the IDL need to be modeled. Which data types are going to
be used, which contracts (interfaces) between components are necessary
and which component provides or use which interface? +
Once this all is determined, the Architect should determine which IDL
should result in which interaction pattern. Once that is determined, the
<<{xref_docs_root}/taox11/ridlc.adoc#,RIDL compiler>> is able to generate all
implied IDL and {cxx11} source code for the stubs of that certain
interaction pattern. Mind that the stubs are not implementing the
interaction pattern itself. In *AXCIOMA* it is possible to use various
implementations for each interaction pattern. Which implementation to
use for an interaction pattern is therefor a deployment decision! +
Once the Architect knows which implementation for a certain interaction
pattern is going to be used, the RIDL compiler is than able to generate
the full implementation of the interaction pattern. In the meantime the
Programmer does not depend on this effort; the programmer can start
working on the business code. This is because of the fact that the user
defined business components do not have any knowledge about which
implementation is used for which interaction pattern. In other words:
there's no need for the component to link against the interaction
pattern implementation libraries and thus business component libraries
can be build independent of the interaction pattern implementation
libraries.

=== Programmer/tester

As mentioned before, the Programmer can start working on the business
code once the business components are modeled in IDL, the data stub
libraries, and the interaction pattern stub libraries are available. To
prevent the Programmer from writing a lot of boiler plate code, the RIDL
compiler is able to generate starter code for the business code (see
<<executor_starter_code.adoc#,this page>>). The Programmer is now
able to implement the business code without having to bother about
boiler plate code.

=== Deployment planner

The Deployment Planner starts the construction of a deployment plan
(check <<{xref_docs_root}/dancex11/deployment-planning.adoc#,this page>>
about how this is done). Besides this, the deployment planner need to
define the (DDS) QoS settings (if applicable). In *AXCIOMA* QoS settings
are a deployment decision and these are never coded. +
With the deployment plan, the QoS settings, and the collected
libraries, the planner is able to run the application by making use of
the <<{xref_docs_root}/dancex11/dancex11.adoc#,*AXCIOMA* deployment
framework>>.

.Structuring
****
When developing an *AXCIOMA* application, good practice is to divide
the IDL and MPC files, libraries, and directory structure in the same
way *AXCIOMA* tests and examples are divided. More information about
this can be found on <<good_practice.adoc#,this page>>.
