This example demonstrated and verifies the "remote" connector vs "colocated" connector
connection options for synchronous request/reply interaction.

The test defines one interface:
1. interface Foo

For 1. a CORBA4CCM connector is generated.

The test demonstrates that:
- for 1. a using component instance can be connected to a remote deployed providing instance
  using two appropriately located CORBA4CCM connector instances
  AND
  another using component instance can be connected to a colocated providing instance using
  two colocated (wrt connector and component instances) CORBA4CCM connector instances
