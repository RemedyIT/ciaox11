= The CORBA4CCM connector

== Design

Each remote IDL interface that is used in a synchronous request/reply
interaction pattern between a providing component instance and a
component instance that is using that interface requires an
implementation of the synchronous request/reply interaction pattern.

An implementation of a synchronous request/reply interaction pattern
should on one hand provide the interface which a certain user defined
component needs (uses) and on the other hand should use the interface
another user defined component provides (see image below).

image:{images_root}/corba4ccm/cc.png[image]

This way the user defined component never has remote CORBA connections
to other components, it only has local connections to connector
fragments. Remote connections are taken care of by the connector
fragments which realize a specific interaction pattern. As a result at
development time a user defined component only has to know of the
existence of the stub and the lem (local executor mapping) stub library.

All this can be summarized in the following IDL:

.CORBA4CCM connector IDL
[source,idl]
-----------------------------------------------
module Connector_T
{
  porttype CORBA_Port_Type
  {
    provides T facet;
    uses T receptacle;
  };
  connector CORBA_Connector
  {
    // srr stands for synchronous request/reply
    port CORBA_Port_Type srr;
  };
};
-----------------------------------------------

Where T is the interface for which a synchronous request/reply
interaction pattern is needed.

== Example

The examples in this document follow the
<<{xref_docs_root}/ciaox11/philosophy.adoc#,*AXCIOMA* philosophy>> and the
directory structure mentioned in the
<<{xref_docs_root}/ciaox11/good_practice.adoc#,Good practice>> guide.

=== IDL

.base IDL
[source,idl]
-----------------------------------------------------
module Hello
{
  interface MyFoo
  {
    string foo (in string in_str, out string answer);
  };

  interface MyBar
  {
    string bar (in string in_str, out string answer);
  };
};

-----------------------------------------------------

.Component IDL, using Foo and Bar
[source,idl]
--------------------------
module Hello
{
  component Sender
  {
    uses MyFoo run_my_foo;
    uses MyBar run_my_bar;
  };
};

--------------------------

.Component IDL, providing Foo and Bar
[source,idl]
-----------------------------
module Hello
{
  component Receiver
  {
    provides MyFoo do_my_foo;
    provides MyBar do_my_bar;
  };
};

-----------------------------

=== Compilation

Best practice is to split the compilation of the base IDL. A stub
library is the smallest entity which is needed by all components,
connectors, and interaction pattern implementations. The files for this
library need to be generated and compiled as a first step. For the base
IDL the components and connectors that will provide a port of a specific
interface also need the local executor mapping (LEM) of that interface.

For each user defined component a component local executor mapping has
to be generated and compiled into a component lem stub. This library
contains local interfaces for the framework to communicate with the user
defined component. The {cxx11} source files needed for this library can be
generated out of the component IDL.

After this, it is possible to implement and compile the user defined
components since these do not need more then the stub and the lem stub
libraries.

Since the user defined components are making use of the synchronous
request/reply interaction pattern, an implementation for this
interaction pattern should be available. When compiling the above IDL
for a CORBA4CCM connector, the *AXCIOMA* RIDL compiler creates the following
implied IDL:

[source,c++]
--------------------------------------------------------------
module CCM_CORBA::Connector_T< Hello::MyFoo > Hello_MyFoo_SRR;
module CCM_CORBA::Connector_T< Hello::MyBar > Hello_MyBar_SRR;
--------------------------------------------------------------

This IDL is compiled, generating the {cxx11} source code for the stub, the
lem stub, the skeleton, and the implementation of the CORBA4CCM connector
itself. These can all be compiled into one shared library because all
the generated code for the `CCM_CORBA::Connector_T` is only needed by
the CORBA4CCM connector and not by any user component.

The resulting library contains the implementation of two CORBA
connectors; one for MyFoo and one for MyBar, each with its own entry
point that can be used by the deployment tooling to create an instance
of the connector.

=== Deployment

Besides the user defined components, the CORBA4CCM connectors should also be
declared in the deployment plan. Note that there should be a CORBA
connector instance be declared for the MyFoo interface as well as for
the MyBar interface (see deployment plan below). More information about
deployment plans can be found
<<{xref_docs_root}/dancex11/config-plan.adoc#,here>>.

Note that when the user wants to use a different implementation for the
synchronous request/reply interaction pattern, all the user has to do is
to add this to the deployment plan (or replace a synchronous
request/reply CORBA4CCM connector instances in the plan). The naming of the
connections between the user component and the connectors remain the
same.

Also note that implementations of certain interaction patterns cannot
interact with each other; a CORBA4CCM connector cannot communicate with a
RPC over DDS connector and vice versa.
