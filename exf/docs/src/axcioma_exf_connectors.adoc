= ExF Connectors

This document describes the basic instructions for building (if applicable) and using ExF enabled connectors for
any of the supported interaction patterns.

== Standard connectors

== User defined connectors

=== Development using BRIX11 APC

Using link:{docs_root}/ciaox11/axcioma_project_tool.html[BRIX11 APC] is the preferred way to develop your ExF enabled (or regular) connectors
since BRIX11 APC handles all specifics and dependencies for code generation and compilation for you based on an
automatic analysis of your APC recipes and IDL files.

To create ExF enabled connectors only a single additional property, `use_exf`, needs to be specified for
your regular connector recipes which is described link:{docs_root}/ciaox11/axcioma_project_tool.html#_connector_recipe[here]. With this
property set the BRIX11 `apc prepare` command will now generate the correct project build files to drive ExF enabled
connector generation and compilation.

The *AXCIOMA* distribution includes multiple tests and examples of BRIX11 APC based projects for ExF which you can
inspect for more details.

In case you prefer classic, MPC based development (described in the next section) you could still use BRIX11 APC to
generate initial MPC example files to use as templates. Using the `-m` switch for the BRIX11 `apc prepare` command
you direct BRIX11 APC to refrain from removing the auto-generated MPC files after generation of the project build
files.

=== Classic development

This section describes the requirements for developing ExF enabled user defined connectors using the classic,
MPC based approach.
The directives described here only describe the basic requirements. Other requirements to control other aspects
of code generation (export directives) or compilation (project dependencies) may apply. Check out the tests and
examples included with the *AXCIOMA* distribution to get more details.
