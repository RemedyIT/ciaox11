A requirement from the field dictates that a topic name should be changeable.
When the topic name will be set a second time, the connector should shut down
DDS and start it again, using the new topic name. The connector does not tear
down the proxies. This means that the connector doesn't change on the outside.

This test has the following sequence:
1. Sender starts writing samples for TopicI
2. Sender informs the Receiver that samples have been written for TopicI
3. Receiver sets this topic name on his connector (late binding), and starts to
   collect the samples.
4. Receiver informs the Sender that the Receiver has read everything
5. Sender changes its topic name to TopicII
6. Sender writes samples for TopicII
7. Sender informs the Receiver that samples have been written for TopicII
8. Receiver resets its topic name to TopicII
9. Receiver reads the samples for TopicII
