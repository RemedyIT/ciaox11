|Question |Solution
| Why should I use <<{xref_docs_root}/tt4ccm/tt4ccm.adoc#,TT4CCM>> support instead
of using the ACE Reactor |
The TT4CCM support will work together with the AXCIOMA Execution Framework where
the ACE Reactor will not. It is only safe to use the ACE Reactor in the single threaded
execution model.
